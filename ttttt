Thank you again for discussing the full-time opportunity with me. I truly appreciate your support and enjoy being part of the team.

I wanted to clarify why I won’t be able to convert to full-time in November 2025, and why I need to wait until around July 2026.

I’m currently going through an immigration-related process with my current employer. The first step in this process, known as PERM Labor Certification, was recently filed. This stage typically takes about 12 to 14 months to complete, so we’re expecting approval around June or July 2026.

Only after this step is completed can the next stage (I-140 petition) be filed. If I change employers before completing these steps, the entire process would have to start over, which would lead to a significant delay.

Because of this, I won’t be able to consider a full-time role until the current process reaches a critical milestone, expected by mid-2026.

I'm fully committed to continuing in my current role and contributing to the team's success. Please let me know if you’d like to discuss this further.

Best regards,
Raghava
