You are given EMC / PowerMax FA (front-end) WWPNs. Your task is to reverse-engineer and produce a deterministic decoder that outputs the following fields in a single CSV row:

WWPN,Array Serial No,Made In,Array Model,Dir,Proc,Port

Few-Shot Examples (Ground Truth)

Example 1
Input WWPN: 5000097210310005
Output CSV:
5000097210310005,HK120203136,USA,PowerMax 8500,1,D,5

Example 2
Input WWPN: 5000097210310006
Output CSV:
5000097210310006,HK120203136,USA,PowerMax 8500,1,D,6

Example 3
Input WWPN: 5000097210310007
Output CSV:
5000097210310007,HK120203136,USA,PowerMax 8500,1,D,7

Your Task

Using the examples above, infer the decoding logic and produce a complete decoder.

You must:

Identify and explain the bit/nibble ranges used for each field (hex nibble index 0 = MSB).

Show how the WWPN is converted from hex → binary → extracted fields.

Provide:

A concise algorithm (pseudocode)

A complete Python implementation (no external libraries)

Validate your decoder by running it on all three examples and reproducing the exact CSV outputs.

Additional Requirements:

Treat the provided examples as authoritative ground truth.

If alternate interpretations exist, list them and describe which exact bit ranges produce them.

If you need more samples to infer the model, ask for them — but first attempt decoding using only the examples.

Output Format (strict):

Your response must contain only:

Explanation of bit/nibble ranges

Pseudocode

Python implementation

Verification runs for the three examples
No greetings, no filler text, no unrelated commentary.
