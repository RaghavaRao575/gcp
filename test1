Hi [Manager's Name],

Thank you again for discussing the full-time opportunity with me. I really enjoy working with the team and appreciate your support.

I wanted to explain why I won’t be able to convert to full-time in November 2025 and why I need to wait until around July 2026.

Right now, my current employer is sponsoring my Green Card under the EB2 process, which has multiple steps:

The first step, called PERM Labor Certification, was recently filed. This step alone takes about 12–14 months, so I’m expecting approval around June or July 2026.

Only after the PERM is approved can we file the I-140 petition, which is a critical step in the Green Card process.

If I switch employers before the PERM is approved and the I-140 is filed, I would have to start the whole process from scratch, which would delay my Green Card by several years.

That’s the main reason I can't make a full-time move until at least mid-2026.

I'm fully committed to continuing as a contractor and contributing to our projects. Please let me know if you’d like to talk more about this — happy to chat.
